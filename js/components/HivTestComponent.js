    <p class="pt-4 red-span"><span>What To Expect!</span>
      It’s important to know what you are comfortable with and conveying that to your partner(s); you deserve to be with people who respect your boundaries.
      E.g. “This would feel even better for me” or “Lemme show you how I like it” or “I need condoms to have sex” </p>
      <p class="pt-4 red-span"><span>How do I know if/ when I’m getting
      tested for HIV?</span>
      No matter what kind of HIV test you’re getting, your consent matters! Consent, in this case, means that it is your choice to have an HIV test, and no one can force you to have one if you do not want to. </p>

        <p class="pt-4">In most provinces and territories of Canada, (aside from Quebec), HIV is a reportable illness. This means that providers who come across a positive test result have a duty to report that result in public health representatives. You might have heard about the partner-notification system. This system exists to ensure that people know they are at risk of getting HIV and to encourage people to get tested as quickly as possible.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-center text-md-right">
          <p class="p-4"> In Canada, when you test positive for HIV, you would be asked by a healthcare provider or a public health official to get in touch with people who may have been exposed to HIV since your last test. This would include anyone you are sexually active with, as well as anyone you share drugs with. If you don’t want to let people know directly, you can also share these people’s contact information with Public Health, and they will contact your partners for you letting them know that they may want to get tested for HIV. They will not reveal your HIV status to anyone, however, in cases of monogamous relationships, people may guess about where they were exposed to HIV.</p>

            <p class="p-4">If you volunteer to have an HIV test, you are giving consent to a provider to do the test for you.
            Sometimes, service providers may offer you an HIV test. This can happen in a couple of different ways: HIV testing may be offered to people through opt-in testing, or opt-out testing. In opt-in testing, a service provider would ask you if you’re interested in the test, and you have the choice to agree or not. In some cases, opt-out testing is offered. In this case, a provider would tell you that HIV testing is a part of routine testing for everyone, but that you have the option of saying no. (If you don’t say no in this case, providers are legally allowed to do the test.)
