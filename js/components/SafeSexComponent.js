          <p>The criminal law considers that not telling a sexual partner your HIV-positive
            status can
            invalidate their consent to have sex when:
            Sex poses a “realistic possibility of transmission”; and,
            A sexual partner would not have consented to have sex if they had known that the other person
            was HIV-positive.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Internal condoms look like pouches. In order to be effective at preventing HIV, insert internal condoms inside the vagina or anus during sex and use condoms that are made from polyurethane, or nitrile. Make sure you use a new condom each time you have sex.
          Lately, condoms haven’t been getting much love from young people, and this is causing a huge outbreak in STIs across Canada, including syphilis, which is making a comeback at rates we haven’t seen since 1948! </p>

Sexual health is everyone’s responsibility.</p>

          It’s hard to talk about sexual health and prevention strategies. There’s still a lot of stigmas and people have a hard time asking each other about getting tested and using condoms. When someone opens up to you about their experience with STIs or HIV, it’s important to listen and stay kind, present, and knowledgeable. Make room for honesty, kindness, and vulnerability when you’re sharing hard-to-talk about experiences with one another.</p>
