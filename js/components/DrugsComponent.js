Psychoactive means that the substance has some effect on mental processes, such as mood, thinking, or behavior. Most Canadians use some kind of substance in their lifetime, so if you use, know that youâ€™re not alone. People use substances for different reasons, like coping with physical or emotional pain, personal enjoyment, relaxing, or socializing.</p>

                    <p class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 p-4 align-text-bottom">Certain groups of people are at higher risk of HIV due to how HIV is transmitted, the mode of transmission, and other social factors that may increase the risk of being exposed to HIV. The HIV prevalence rate among youth who are street-involved (between ages 15 and 24) is 5xhigher than in youth who are not street-involved. Among youth who inject drugs (between ages 15 and 24), HIV prevalence is 15x higher than in youth who do not inject drugs. If you are at risk of getting HIV from sharing any drug equipment, know that there are ways to minimize risk!</p>
