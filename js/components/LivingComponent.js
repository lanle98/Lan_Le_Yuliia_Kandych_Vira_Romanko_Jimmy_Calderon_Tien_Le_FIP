                <p>Telling someone you have HIV is your decision. You don’t have to disclose your status to family,
                    friends, or healthcare providers outside of your HIV healthcare provider. You don’t have to tell
                    your co-workers, employers, people at school, or landlords. There is some legal stuff to think about
                    when telling sexual partners about your HIV status. Disclosure involves a lot of other things to
                    consider too. Here are some questions you can ask yourself or discuss within your circle of support:

                <p>There are also resources on HIV transmission, which may be helpful in discussions around disclosure.
                    Disclosure involves a complex mix of psychological, emotional, social, sexual and legal issues, and
                    can be overwhelming for many people. Disclosure may feel risky or threatening on many different
                    levels.</p>

                    <p class="col-md-6">Disclosure is complex and can cause people significant anxiety. It may be
                        especially difficult if
                        the diagnosis is recent and the person is still processing their own thoughts and feelings about
                        it.
                        Depending on individual circumstances, a person might feel they are risking their relationship,
                        whether new or already established. </p>

                <p>They might fear questions about their history and how they got HIV. They might fear anger, violence,
                    rejection, discrimination, legal repercussions, or the loss of their children, home, financial
                    security, privacy or immigration status. These can be profoundly difficult fears for anyone to face.

                    <p class="col-md-6">The criminal law considers that not telling a sexual partner your HIV-positive
                        status can
                        invalidate their consent to have sex when:
                        Sex poses a “realistic possibility of transmission”; and,
                        A sexual partner would not have consented to have sex if they had known that the other person
                        was HIV-positive.</p>

                <p>When these two conditions are met, HIV non-disclosure is considered fraud vitiating consent (there is
                    no legally recognized consent because ‘deception’ created a misunderstanding about what was being
                    consented to). HIV- nondisclosure transforms otherwise consensual sex into sexual assault.</p>
