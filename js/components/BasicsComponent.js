            <p class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 p-4 align-text-bottom">HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is a virus that attacks the immune system. It attacks and destroys white blood cells and makes copies of itself in these cells, which are our body’s natural defense against illness. 
                As the white blood cells are destroyed and more copies of the HIV are made, without treatment, a person’s immune system is broken down. This makes it harder and harder for the person to fight off infections and diseases. If HIV is untreated, it may take up to a decade for the immune system to be so severely damaged that it can no longer defend itself at all. The speed that HIV progresses depends on a person’s age, health, and background. This final level of infection is called AIDS.</p>

These symptoms or illnesses is known as the last stage of HIV, or advanced HIV infection, which is ultimately AIDS. When HIV is so advanced that it has transformed into AIDS, and if left untreated, could lead to death.</p>
